// #1 what is lambda expression in java?
// -- In Java, a lambda expression is a concise way to implement a functional interface. 
//    A functional interface is an interface that has only one abstract method, and it can be implemented using a lambda expression.

// #2 Properties of the lambda expression
// Concise syntax: Lambda expressions provide a concise and expressive syntax for defining functional interfaces. 
// They allow you to define the behaviour of a functional interface in a single line of code.


// Functional programming: Lambda expressions are a key component of functional programming in Java. 
// They allow you to write code that is more declarative and expressive, and less verbose than traditional imperative code.

// No need for anonymous inner classes: Lambda expressions provide an alternative to anonymous inner classes, which are often 
// used to implement functional interfaces in Java. Lambda expressions are more concise and easier to read than anonymous inner classes.
